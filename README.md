Here’s a simple and professional **README.md** file for your **Task Management Web API** project:

---

# Task Management Web API

A **Task Management Web API** built with **ASP.NET Core** that allows users to manage tasks, assign them to team members, set deadlines, and track their statuses.

## Features

- **Create a Task**: Add new tasks with details like name, description, assignee, deadline, and status.
- **Retrieve All Tasks**: Fetch all tasks or filter tasks based on assignee or status.
- **Retrieve Task by ID**: Get details of a specific task by its unique ID.
- **Update a Task**: Modify the task details such as name, description, assignee, deadline, or status.
- **Delete a Task**: Remove a task from the system.

## Technologies Used

- **.NET 6 / .NET 7**: Framework for building the Web API.
- **ASP.NET Core**: For creating RESTful APIs.
- **Swagger**: For API documentation and testing.
